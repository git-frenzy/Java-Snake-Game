In this project, I developed a snake game using Java. The game involves a snake that moves around a board, trying to eat food while avoiding running into walls or its own body. To create the game, I used data structures such as arrays and lists to store the game state and algorithms such as breadth-first search to calculate the snake's movements. I also implemented object-oriented programming concepts and developed a GUI using JavaFX.
